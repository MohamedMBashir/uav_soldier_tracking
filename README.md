## Overview

This project demonstrates a sophisticated object tracking system I developed to identify and track soldiers in military UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) footage. It's built around Yolov8, a cutting-edge deep learning model, which I enhanced through custom training on a carefully selected dataset. This dataset was created by extracting and augmenting military UAV footage, then precisely labeled using Roboflow for optimal model performance.

I utilized the Ultralytics and Supervision libraries to create a highly effective tracking application, enabling real-time monitoring of soldiers in various environments.
